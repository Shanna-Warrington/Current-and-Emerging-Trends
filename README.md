# Current-and-Emerging-Trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project we were given the base code that set up the background functions such as setting up the map or maze. We were tasked with creating the "D-training algorithm" which would let the agent reach the goal. In this case a pirate finding treasure.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
A computer scientist uses technology to solve various problems. If there is an issue that can be solved with a program or app then that would be computer science. It can be a very diverse field. There are ways to solve medical, financal,  or social problems. This allows the world to be better without the backbreaking manual work. It also typically presents a faster and more efficient resolution.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I would first decide if it is an issue that can be solved with technology. We are not quite at the point that every job is technology based. If it can be solved with technology, I would first brainstorm a basic design/schematic that would help resolve said issue. Without a good plan of action you could be running in circles trying to fix it. Getting a plan of action and troubleshooting as much as possible before the actual creation will help stream line the production. It helps to fix any problems or errors during the design stage so that there are not as many in the implementaion stage.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
It is my ethical responsibility to create a program that works as best as possible, while still being secure and cost effective. There is no sense in creating something that is not going to keep the user or organizations information private. Also what would be the point to make something so exspensive that hardly anyone could afford it. We are trying to make programs that can be used by many and help many people.
